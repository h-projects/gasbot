# Contributing

**The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, please ask it in the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/z2QsKF7ZJ6) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.**

If you wish to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository and submit a
pull request. We use Biome to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in your editor of choice
is a great boon to your development process.

## Setup

To get ready to work on the codebase, please do the following:

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the **main** branch
2. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
3. Code!
4. Run `node --run test` to run all needed checks
5. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/h-projects/gasbot/compare) (Make sure you follow the conventional commit format)
