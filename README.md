## G Removal
By default, it removes standalone G, but by usinq `h!detector` this can be chanqed to one of these options:

### Low
Lowest option, deletes a messaqe if it only consists of G. Detects `g` but not `test g test`

### Medium
Default option, only detects G if it's outside words. Detects `test g test` but not `germany`. Recommended option

### Hiqh
Hiqhest option, detects G even inside words. Detects `germany` and `message`. Useful if your server is beinq raided by g-spies
